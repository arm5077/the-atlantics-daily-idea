- to run/test, just type "node index.js" or filename
- be liberal with ya console.logs!!
- check the aws lambda logs!!!
- write some damn js

- can go to "distribute" tab in the alexa dev console and set up everything to beta test, and invite people

- can turn on "audioplayer" etc in the dev console, and use docs like: https://developer.amazon.com/docs/custom-skills/audioplayer-interface-reference.html
